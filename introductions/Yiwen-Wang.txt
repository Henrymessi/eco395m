Hi everyone! My name is Yiwen Wang and I am interested in International Economics and Financial Economics. In addition, I'm willing to some programming languages like R and Python in order to become competitive in job markets.I like reading some historical books and I'm crazy about watching sports games especially FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi. Hope we can learn and make progress in this semester's class.
